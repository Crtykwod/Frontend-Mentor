## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology


### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout. I also used CSS custom properties to define colors and fonts in a more organized way. This was my first project using BEM methodology, and I found it very useful to write more organized CSS classes. I used BEM to organize my CSS classes in a more structured way, by dividing them into three types: block, element and modifier. For example, for the `header` block, I created the following classes: `header__logo`, `header__nav`, `header__nav--active`, `header__nav--desktop-hidden`, etc. This way, I could easily target the elements I wanted to style and keep my CSS organized.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on improving my skills in using BEM methodology. Although I found it very useful in organizing my CSS classes in a more structured way, I know there's still room for improvement. I want to continue using BEM in my future projects and refine my skills in creating more organized and structured CSS classes.

### Useful resources

- [BEM Official Website](https://getbem.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand BEM. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
