## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS nesting
- CSS Grid *(**A lot of Grid!!**)*

### What I learned

Before doing this exercise, I studied a lot about CSS Grid, so you will notice that almost all elements have:
```css
{
display: grid;
row-gap: x;
}
```
That's because I wanted to do with Grid, everything I was used to do with Flexbox.  

I also decided to learn about CSS nesting, because I was interested in SCSS and ended up discovering CSS nesting. Therefore, you will find many:
```css
.custom-selector {
   ...
   .custom- 
   selector__green {
       ...
       a {
           ...
       }
    }
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid Garden](https://cssgridgarden.com/) - This is an amazing browser game which helped me finally understand `display: grid`. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
- [CSS Grid Layout Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/#prop-justify-self) - This guide helped me because of its completeness. I found it very useful and will be re-reading it whenever necessary.
