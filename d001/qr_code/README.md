## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand flexbox concepts like flex-grow, flex-shrink and flex-basis. I used them to fix the footer at the bottom of the page.
It also helped me learning about Mobile-first workflow.

```css
.back {
  flex: 1 0 auto;
}

.footer {
  flex-shrink: 0;
}

```

### Continued development

I still have a lot to learn about flexbox, because it took me too much time in this project.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow - Fix footer to bottom of page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18915550/fix-footer-to-bottom-of-page) - This helped me fixing the footer and taught me about flex property. It was very usefull!
