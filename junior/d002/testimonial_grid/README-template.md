## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive grid layout. I also learned how to use the `:nth-child` pseudo-class to target specific elements in the grid. Additionally, I learned how to use the `grid-template-columns` property to define the number of columns in the grid.

### Continued development

I would like to continue focusing on responsive design and learning more about creating a fully responsive website. I would also like to learn more about accessibility and how to make my website more accessible to people with disabilities. Additionally, I would like to continue learning more about CSS Grid and how to use it to create more complex layouts.

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs - CSS Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) - This helped me understand how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive grid layout.
- [CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive grid layout. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
